## How to Run / Use

1. Open the project in StackBlitz (or fork it).  
2. Type a city name or latitude,longitude in the input box.  
3. Press **Enter** or click the **Get Weather** button.  
4. View current weather & 3-day forecast.

## Input Formats

You can use two formats in the search input:

| Format | Example | Behavior |
| **City name** | `Mumbai` or `New York` | Uses geocoding to get lat/lon, then fetches weather |
| **Latitude,Longitude** | `28.61,77.21` | Directly fetches weather for that coordinate pair |

If the input is invalid (e.g. wrong format or no results), you‚Äôll see a friendly error message.

## Known Limitations & Possible Improvements

- Weather codes mapped through emoji & text only ‚Äî real weather icons could improve look.  
- Only 3-day forecast is shown ‚Äî could extend to 7-day or hourly.  
- No caching of API results ‚Äî repeated requests make fresh API calls each time.  
- Styling could be polished further (animations, transitions, mobile optimizations, etc.).
